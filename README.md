This module was developed to exercise several new concepts to try to get them into muscle memory. Tutorials followed to create this are: 
* [pbs.bartificer.net/pbs127](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs127) on NPM and Node
* [pbs.bartificer.net/pbs128](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs128) on JavaScript Module Basics
* [pbs.bartificer.net/pbs131](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs131) on JSDoc
* [pbs.bartificer.net/pbs132](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs132) on JSDoc themes
* [pbs.bartificer.net/pbs135](https://pbs.bartificer.net/pbs135) on Jest

1. Create an entry point script file that imports a module. The module will calculate the total number of seconds from an array of 3 numbers representing hours, minutes, and seconds.
2. npm had to be initiatlized and installed, creating the packag-lock.json file.
3. The package.json file was created and the dependencies were added.
4. Initialized as a git repo from the command line and pushed to a remote on GitHub
5. Installed JSDoc and created documentation
6. Installed Jest and created tests (and passed them)

Everything, including git, was done from the command line.
